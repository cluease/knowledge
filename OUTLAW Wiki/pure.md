 [Verse]
why you're treating me like (like-like)
like someone that you never loved?
like i'm another thing to drop
i hope i'm not the only one
(you telling this)
texting you in a while
 i bet you didn't even try
 you have another shoulder to cry
 when i'm just standing on a line, oh

[chorus]
yo-o-o-ou
you got me 
you got me, so pure
these feelings im feeling with you 
i fear that nobody can do, woah-oh

[interlude]
you-u-u just killin me right through the screen
without even realizing it
i can't blame you
but i wan't you to run out of my head tonight

[chorus]
yo-o-o-ou
you got me 
you got me, so pure
these feelings im feeling with you 
i bet that nobody can do, woah-oh

[post-chorus]
twinkling light burning my heart like a sun
tried to get rid of it 
burnt even more
crave for attention
you didn't return
am I no more than a mistake for you
