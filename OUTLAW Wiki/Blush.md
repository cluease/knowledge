[Verse]\

Touch
And my head round
Butterfly, crush
Tryna get talk
Dash, but words refused
Thrilling and confused
Nervous and diffused

[pre-chorus]

e-e-h 
i tryna be the better version of me
so you can easily go and fall in love with me
don't pay attention, just snore
you look so cold, although that makes me wanna love you more


[chorus]

blush
and my heart rushed
fantasize much
wan't your light touch
you can grab my hair right
i might quite like it
wish you could be mine
and i'm not gonna recede
no matter ah, how much you try-y

[verse]







Not that bold anymore
